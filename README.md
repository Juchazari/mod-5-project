# Final Project

This is my Flatiron MOD 5 Final project which will incorporate all
the technologies that were taught and learned within the program.

The following technologies used in this project:

- Ruby
- Rails
- PostgreSQL
- JWT (Authentication)
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- TBD

Currently, Rails is being used as a backend API and React for the client side (frontend).
At the moment, most of the styling for this project is custom but I might incorporate bootstrap
or some other CSS framework later down the line. JSON Web Tokens is being used for authenticatation
in order to learn both sides of the story (JWT vs good old sessions).

## Project Idea

The main idea behind this project is to provide a way of managing projects and inspired by many other
project managers such as Trello, Monday, Taskworld, etc.
